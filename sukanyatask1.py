#Difference between python2 and python3
python2:
   * If you print any function you cannot use parantheses.
    Ex: print"Hello"
   * You can divide the two integer values you will get output  nearest whole number.
   Ex: 5/2=2
   *This syntax is difficult to understend.
   *We can iterate the function you used to Xrange() function.
   *to store unicode string value you require to define them with "u".

python3 :
    * If you print any function you necessary use parantheses .
     Ex : print("Hello")
    * you can divide two integers values you will get a float value.
     Ex : 5/2=2.5
    * This syntax is simple and easy to understand.
    * We can iterate the function  the new Range() function is used.
    * Default storing of string is unicode.


#Difference between compiler and interpreter
 Compiler      * A compiler is a translator which transform high level language into machine language.
     * In program compilation done before execution.
     * The speed of compiler is faster.
     * In compiler error detection is difficult.
     * Compiler display all errors after compilation of a program.
 Interpreter :
     * An interpreter is a program which imitates the execution of programs written in asource language.
     * An interpreterboth compilation and execution takes place simultaneously.
     * The speed of interpreter is slower.
     * An interpreter  error detection is easier.
     * An interpreter display errors line one by one.

     
# What's Escape sequence


     * An escape sequence is a combination of characters that has a special meaning. 
     * In python Escape sequence are denoted by a backslash (\).
     * The most important one may be \n indicates a new line.
     * Another escape sequence wroth mentioning is \' for a single quote whithin a string.
     
Examples :
    1. \newline =Blackslash and newline ignored
     print("line1\line2\line3")
     2. \\ =Blackslash(\)
         print("\\")
    3. \' =single quote(')
         print('\'')
    4. \" =Double quote(")
         print("\"")



# Good features of python programming language
                        
    * Python is high level,free open source programming language.
    * Python supports object orientedprogramming as well as procedural oriented programming.
    * python is easy to learn.
    * In python we dont need to declare the type of variable because it is a dynamic programming language.
      Ex : x=12 it means x is a integer or string                  
     * Python is a extensible language.we can write code in c or c++ languages we can compile that code in c or c++ languages.
    * we can run python program in any platform.                    
     * Python has a large standard library it provides rich set of modules and functions.
